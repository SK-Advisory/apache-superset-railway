[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/iwmSTQ?referralCode=pJ9Yn8&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

## Why this?

Apache Superset has Docker images for deployment but the setting of the admin user requires executing code in the container. That is not possible to set up in a Railway template. This modification supports the creation of the admin user through setting of environment variables.
